# es-fluent-core

The `es-fluent-core` crate provides the foundational logic for the `es-fluent` ecosystem. It contains the core data structures, parsing logic, and analysis tools required to extract translation information from Rust source code decorated with `es-fluent` attributes.

This crate is primarily intended for internal use by other `es-fluent` crates, such as `es-fluent-derive` and `es-fluent-build`. It is generally not a crate that you would use directly in your application.
