# es-fluent-core

**Internal Crate**: Core types and traits for `es-fluent`.

This contains the shared definitions used by the macros (`es-fluent-derive`), the CLI (`es-fluent-cli`), and the runtime managers. You generally do not need to depend on this crate directly, as its types are re-exported where needed.
