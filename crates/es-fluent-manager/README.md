# es-fluent-manager

a i18n manager which relies on [inventory](https://github.com/dtolnay/inventory) for collecting all [es-fluent](../es-fluent/README.md) based i18n modules. Should work out of the box for most projects.

We provide an adapter for [bevy](https://bevy.org/) : [click me](../es-fluent-manager-bevy//README.md)
